        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a self-taught student who wants to be a front-end developer. I learned Python and took a course about applying AI methods to water resources in my master's education. These have enlightened me to seek a career in software development. After graduation, I got into the Game and Application Academy bootcamp program. 
            Afterward, I continued to expand my knowledge horizontally by learning data structure, algorithms, OOP, databases, and front-end development. </p>
